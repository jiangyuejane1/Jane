1.The topic I would like to work in the following weeks:

The situation of female artists' works and female figures in the collection of Mauritshuis Museum.

2. context for the topic:

When I read the book Data Feminism(Catherine D'Ignazio & Lauren F. Klein, 2020), I learned that in 1989, the Guerrilla Girls, an anonymous collective of women artists, published a graph called Do Women Have to Be Naked to Get into the Met. Museum? The graph states: "Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Museum Art sections are women, but 85% of the nudes are female. " The Guerrilla Girls counted the Met's artists and nude women in their paintings to present the unfair situation of women in art collections - it is clear that museums have few paintings by women artists. However, it is more likely to collect paintings with nude female subjects. I am curious about how is the situation in the Netherlands. In view of the fact that all the paintings can be found on the website of the Mauritshuis Museum conveniently, I choose this museum for research.


3.RQ: What is the status of female artists' works and female figures in the paintings Mauritshuis Museum?


4. How I think I can explore the proposed topic and address the RQ and what kind of data I need to answer my RQ:

I will count the proportion of female nudes and female images in the paintings of the Mauritshuis Museum and the proportion of female artists' works in the total works, presenting the situation of female artists' works and female images in the collections of the Mauritshuis Museum. So to answer my RQ, the data I need is the gender of the author of each painting, paintings featuring women, paintings featuring nude women, and their respective counts.
